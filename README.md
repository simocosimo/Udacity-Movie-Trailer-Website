#1)Presentation

This is my submission for the Udacity "Full Stack Web Developer" Nanodegree.
This project is the Movie Trailer Website.
Basically, running entertainment_center.py, a web page will be created and a list of movies will be displayed.
The user can read the title, the year of publishing, the director and the plot
of my favourite movie.
These informations are displayed under the poster image. Are you curious to see the trailer?
No problem! Just click on the movie and enjoy the trailer!

#2)How to run

In order to run this Python script the user needs to have Python version 2.7.9 installed
(not Python 3 or above, the script may not running as expected).
Make sure you have the three files (media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py and entertainment_center.py)
in the same folder before running the script.
Finally, you can open entertainment_center.py with your Python console and run the script
or open the Command Prompt (if you are on Windows) or a Terminal,
navigate to the folder where the files are, and execute the command
'python entertainment_center.py'
(this works only if Python was added to the Windows Path).

#3)Changes to fresh_tomatoes

I made some changes to fresh_tomatoes.py.
The first one is the number of informations that are displayed under the poster image.
Now the user can see the plot, the director and the year of publishing.
The title in the main black bar at the top of the web page is now displaying the number of movies in the page
(this is made with a Class variable passed to open_movies_page function as an argument)
